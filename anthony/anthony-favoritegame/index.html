								<h3>Tracer</h3>
							</header>
							<p>With a unique ability to control the speed of her own passage through time, Tracer zips and blinks around the battlefield, eluding attackers and sneaking past defenses. A perfect skirmisher hero, Tracer is fragile but hard to hit, keeping one step ahead of her attackers while she harasses and harries the enemy team. Tracer excels at getting behind enemy lines, but it is inadvisable to move her through chokepoints. Should she find herself blinking into an ambush, she can rewind time to her position and state a few seconds earlier, giving her a second chance.</p>

								<h3>Reaper</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Reaper is a deadly assassin that can move like a ghost through the battlefield, dispatching enemies and draining the life from their corpses, disappearing before their allies can catch him. Reaper is most effective at close quarters, and uses his movement abilities to get close to vulnerable targets. He is at his best when ambushing and swiftly silencing targets before slipping back into the shadows. With his Death Blossom turning him into a deadly whirlwind, Reaper can be devastating in confined spaces, turning an enemy charge into a massacre.</p>

								<h3>D.Va</h3>
							</header>
							<p>D.Va’s mech is nimble and powerful — its twin Fusion Cannons blast away with autofire at short range, and she can use its Boosters to barrel over enemies and obstacles, or deflect attacks with her projectile-dismantling Defense Matrix.p>

								<h3>Widowmaker</h3>
							</header>
							<p>A cold-blooded assassin, Widowmaker is the archetypal sniper, grappling up to vantage points and lining up the perfect kill shot. Her sniper rifle and sticky mines make her a strong Defense hero, staking out choke-points and picking off any target that stands still for too long.</p>
